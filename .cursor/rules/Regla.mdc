‚úÖ 2. Responsive Design

All views must be mobile-friendly.

Use Tailwind‚Äôs responsive utilities (sm:, md:, etc.).

Test UI on mobile viewport before considering it final.



---

‚úÖ 3. Frontend Logic and When to Ask

You can add frontend logic freely if it's:

Simple and local (UI only)

Not security-sensitive

Not related to roles, permissions, or pricing


‚úÖ Allowed examples (no need to ask):

Toggling components

Button loading states

Showing/hiding sections

Local input validation

Simple conditionals


‚ùó You must ask before adding logic that:

Involves user roles, pricing, access

Filters or interprets backend data

Touches Supabase directly in non-standard ways

Bypasses security controls (RLS or edge functions)

Adds a new library or code pattern


If a rule blocks your action, explain:

> ‚ÄúThis action conflicts with rule X. Would you like to override it for this case?‚Äù




---

‚úÖ 4. Code Quality

Reuse existing components and functions when possible.

Remove unused imports or dead code.

Use clear, consistent naming.

Avoid unnecessary abstraction or complexity.

Never mix business logic in UI components.



---

‚úÖ 5. File Structure

Maintain this structure:

/components: UI and reusable parts

/pages: Routes

/utils or /lib: Helpers and logic

/schema: DB schema markdowns


Keep code modular and predictable.


---

‚úÖ 6. Comments & Documentation

Every new file or export must include a short comment about what it does.

Use inline comments only for complex logic.

Code should mostly be self-explanatory.



---

‚úÖ 7. Database Schema (/schema/db.schema.md)

Only update this file when:

Tables are created or deleted

Columns are added/removed

Relationships are changed


üìù Always edit the existing table in place.
üö´ Never duplicate or add a table at the bottom that already exists.
üëÄ Only consult this file when the developer says to do so.


---

‚úÖ 8. Environment Variables

Always use environment variables for:

Supabase URL and keys

Frontend and backend domains

API credentials or third-party endpoints


‚úÖ Applies to both frontend and backend.
üö´ Never hardcode domains or secrets. This keeps deployment flexible.


---

‚úÖ 9. UI Consistency & UX Direction

Reuse shared components for:

Modals

Alerts

Notifications

Messages


Use /components/ui/ for base UI elements.

Follow a clean, modern design style (Tailwind UI or shadcn/ui preferred).

Cursor is encouraged to propose modern UI/UX approaches aligned with leading tech product standards ‚Äî always think in terms of good UX.

Use the official GOOD Talent color palette below when designing or adjusting visual elements:

üé® GOOD Talent Official Color Palette:

#004C4C ‚Äì Dark teal (background base)
#065C5C ‚Äì Medium teal (base layer)
#0A6A6A ‚Äì Light teal (support layer)
#E6F5F7 ‚Äì Soft white (text on dark)
#87E0E0 ‚Äì Light cyan (accent)
#5FD3D2 ‚Äì Turquoise (highlight)
#58BFC2 ‚Äì Cyan (secondary text/accent)

These colors should guide visual consistency across all screens. If a new accent or variant is proposed, please ask first.



---

‚úÖ 10. Rule Conflicts

If a rule blocks a task, Cursor must:

Say which rule is causing the conflict

Ask:

> ‚ÄúThis action conflicts with rule X. Would you like to override it for this case?‚Äù





---

 11. Language and Localization
The application‚Äôs default and only supported language is Spanish. All user-facing text, notifications, alerts, emails, and UI elements must be written in Spanish. No English or other languages should be used in the interface or communications, unless explicitly approved for a specific exception.

---

‚ùå Don‚Äôt:

Expose Supabase keys or business logic in the frontend.

Add direct Supabase operations without security (use RLS or edge functions).

Introduce libraries without approval.

Leave unused code.

Duplicate component logic.

Break responsiveness or accessibility.



---

üß≠ Final Reminder

Backend handles all critical logic.
Frontend handles UI and basic flows.
Cursor has freedom for UI logic, but must ask for anything that impacts security, pricing, or roles.

‚Üí Simple. Secure. Clean. Scalable.
